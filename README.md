# Symplified Structured Data Notation (SSDN) - Documentation

## WHY WAS SSDN CREATED ?                     

SSDN was created as an alternative to XML, JSON, YAML or Protobuf.
SSDN is trying to be the most easiest to both write and read.
                                  
## HOW TO USE SSDN?  

Start of SSDN file - SSDNver=1.1

Under the beginning of the file you write the root element of SSDN,
then you start writing the structure and writing the data.
After each tag/element you type a bracket (in which you press enter and tab, 
depending on which editor you are writing the file in) and start writing either the next tag/element 
and repeat or you type a bracket in which you start writing information/data/attributes.
Each attribute must be separated by a semicolon (;).

Example files are in example folder.
