#SSDML - Symplified Structured Data Markup Language

Symplified Structured Data Markup Language (SSDML) - Documentation

???? WHY WAS SSDML CREATED ????
        ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓                         

SSDML was created as an alternative to XML. 
SSDML solves the problems of both XML and JSON. 
XML is easy to write, but it is messy and hard to read with large amounts of code. 
JSON files are easy to read but don't write as well as XML ones. 
SSDML solves both of these problems.

Start of SSDML file - (SSDML version=1.0)

Under the beginning of the file you write the root element of SSDML,
then you start writing the structure and writing the data.
After each tag/element you type a bracket (in which you press enter and tab, 
depending on which editor you are writing the file in) and start writing either the next tag/element 
and repeat or you type a bracket in which you start writing information/data/attributes.
Each attribute must be separated by a semicolon (;).
